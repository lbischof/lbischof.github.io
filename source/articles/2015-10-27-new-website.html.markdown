title: New Website
---
Last year in July I started my apprenticeship as a Linux System Administrator at Puzzle ITC. Working with Linux is a dream come true and I can't imagine life without automation or the command line. It seems like I started just yesterday, even though I approach completion in a few months. 

I could tell you a lot more about how I work, but let's leave that for a future blog post. Before applying I created my website and after choosing a position, I neglected my portfolio and it became outdated. This new one uses middleman, a static site generator and is hosted on Github. 

Because living in Switzerland doesn't present much opportunity to practice English, I decided to include a blog. If you have any questions or just want to chat don't hesitate to contact me.
